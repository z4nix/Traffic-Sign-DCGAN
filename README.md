# Traffic-Sign-DCGAN
A DCGAN to generate images of Traffic Signs, built using Pytorch. 

This is part of the project for the AI Safety Initiative Groningen (AISIG). The final project consists in employing copy-paste attacks to deceive classifiers fine-tuned on traffic signs, adopting the feature-level attacking strategy presented by [Casper et al](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2110.03605).
